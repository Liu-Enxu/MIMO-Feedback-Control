# MIMO-Feedback-Control
- This project is a final project for 2024WN EECS 565 - Linear Feedback Control Systems at the University of Michigan.
- This project is done by Enxu LIU and Qinwen QIAN.

The project uses MIMO control design with linear quadratic regulator and loop transfer recovery to design the control for the Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) process.
